At the internship the first thing that caught my attention was the badge reader that was implemented in the enterprise. They had 2 of those or even more, I just saw 2: ‚ÄúOne for the first floor and one for the main floor‚Äù. The badges are used to check the working hours of each employee. The company GET is the developer. It is focussed on security of other enterprises, but also themselves.
It is used for security and other security activities. People will also use it at their homes and they will use it instead of a code. It is very handy for the people who have a badge. Only if you lose your badge you can have a little problem, but with the help of the owner of the NFC badge reader you can get a new badge.<br><br>
This review <a href ="http://www.gadgetgear.nl/2015/04/review-myfox-nfc-badgelezer/">MyFoxBadgeReader</a> talks about the MyFox badge reader. I will tell you a bit more about the badge reader like the pros and the contras. Finally I will give you a conclusion what I find about the MyFox Reader.<br><br>

Let us start with that I find about this badge reader. The first thing that is important for me is the User Interface, how it looks and how easily you can work with the device. There are a lot of wizards installed that make it easier for the user. It is a wireless device so you do not have to worry about some cables.
It is a standard model but you recognize the symbols on the device like lock, unlock, home and settings. People who have a device like an Xperia z2/z3 can connect to this device. Of course you as the owner of the device can choose if you want it to connect or not.<br><br>
Then some things I definitely do not like about the device. The options menu for the users is still in French. I hope it will get an update as soon as possible so it has the main language in the options menu. A little bit of a downside it is a fairly standard model it maybe looks kind of boring. It is not a big problem but if you are a fashion person go look for something else üòâ.<br><br>
My conclusion for this device is it is a very handy and easy to install device. You will not have any problems with it even though it looks kind of ugly. With MyFox you have a very good and standard looking device that is easy to install. So if you are looking for security around your house MyFox has always a place in your heart.<br><br>
