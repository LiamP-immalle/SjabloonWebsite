<h2>IT-Biography</h2>

<div id= "stage1">
    <p>
        Hello everyone! My name is Liam Present and I am from Westmalle. Today the day I still study in Immaculata at Oostmalle. What I study is IT and Network. IT is a very interesting study where you learn a lot, like what a server is? How to host a server? I am not like most of my class a Hero in IT but I do really like it and want to learn much from it. <br><br>
        The first time I went on a pc I was feeling in an whole other dimension. In that time I played a lot with Lego and didn’t had a console.  So when my parents bought a pc it was like heaven in the skies. I was like 8 years old and the first things I played on it was an educative game with a bunny. Where I don’t know the name of it. It was a CD game so I thought what else can you find on the internet. I started to look games up like spel.nl and it was really fun and maybe a bit addicting. That was really the time of my life if I look back to that nostalgia. <br><br>
        IT does mean a lot for me. That is just the way it is. It’s my study and I need to go on with it and I really do like it so I don’t think it’s that big of a problem.  After all when I come home now a days I just go on my computer and check new things out. You learn the most by that. Just sitting and going on Facebook and then start programming while I am having some spare time. It’s becoming a daily routine  and I really like the way it becomes an important part in my life. Becoming an expert is not the reason I am doing this. It’s just looking for myself and maybe that I can go on with it in the future.<br><br>
        If I can find something in the future that is with IT and I really do like it I will certainly do it even if it is a “cheap” job.  But if I find something else and I think it’s more laying in my way of living. I think I can easily say that I will get off and over IT.  Just go on with the things my life gives to myself.
